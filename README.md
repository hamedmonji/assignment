# assignment

## Some General notes

i tested the app against iphone 13 and pixel 4, however I did implement the ui and animation to work on different screen sizes i didn't test all of the sizes but it should be ok for the most part.

the background for the bike wasn't in the assets folder for the assignment that's why it's missing.


Too keep things simple i didn't use any special library for json parsing just the manual way.

### resource management

I did use text sizes and style from the theme, however since this was a test i hardcoded things like texts, this would obvously be bad for internationaliztion but it's just for test.


### testing

I've written a few unit tests and one widget test,they are not by any means exhaustive, but rather enough to show the point.

### comments

i put some comments in places where i needed to explain why i did something this way instead of maybe a more mature soloution so you know i was aware!.
